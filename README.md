# Collaborative-Cookbook
The goal of this project is to build a digital cookbook where contributors can add, modify, and review recipes. Each recipe will be stored as a Markdown file in a GitHub repository. Contributors will use GitHub's collaborative features like pull requests, issues, and forks to manage the cookbook.
